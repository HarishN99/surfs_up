## Overview

**Purpose:** This analysis was performed to provide more information about temperature trends for the months of June and Decmeber in Oahu to determine if the business of a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year-round. Comparing the temperature trends in winter and summer provides informaiton on whether customers would seek out generally warm-weather activities/products such as surfing and eating ice cream.

## Summary

Based on the results, specificlaly looking at the average, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation from the mean, the temperatures for the months of June and December in Oahu do not differ drastically. The average temperature for December was jus 4 degrees colder than that of June. Similarily, the maxiumum temperature in December was only 3 degrees colder as well, however the minimum tempearture in December was actually 8 degrees colder. Due to this fact, the standard deviation for the temperatures in december was slighly higher meaning the temperatures had a greater spread. With that being said, seeing as temperatures were very similar between the two months (on most days) there should not be an issue operating the surf and ice cream business year round. 

In the future, conducting an analysis on other months such as March or September may provide a better picture of how the temperature trends vary year-round on Oahu. Even with just the June and Decmeber data, also looking at tepeature trends for each day at specific times can also provide very curcial informaiton which can help decide what times it would be best to operate the business. Other than temperature, another very importand factor when it comes to weather is the wind. Looking at wind speeds for each day in June and December can show any trends or differences between winds in summer and winter. Knowing which seasons or months are windier can help predict days people are less or more likely to surf or want ice cream.
